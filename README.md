ION
===

MIPS32r2 compatible CPU.

This is a refactor of the [ION project available in Opencores] (http://opencores.org/project,ion).

The original project is a MIPS-I implementation whereas this one is meant to be MIPS32r2 compatible.

This project is eventually to be backported to OpenCores.

## Status

Nothing committed so far.
